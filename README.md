# ytdl-discord-bot

An example of how you can implement [ytdl-core](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core) into Discord using [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js). [Screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/RUOAuVj)

## Commands

Without changing anything, you have access to the following commands:

- `play <url, playlist or search>`
- `queue`, `np`, `volume [new volume]`
- `skip`, `stop`, `pause`, `resume`
- `ping`

The default prefix is `Y!`

## How to host yourself

You need to have:
- Node - confirmed working on v10.16.3
- npm - comes with Node, doesn't really matter what version iirc
- A Discord Bot token, and having the bot in your server

One-time setup:
- Rename `config.example.json` to `config.json`, and fill in new values.
- Do `npm i`, wait for it to finish

Start the bot with `node app.js`.

### npm i -g windows-build-tools

Some packages in the code use the npm-package windows-build-tools. For this to be properly installed, you will have to open an administrative command prompt- or powershell-window and type `npm i -g windows-build-tools` and wait a good while until it finishes. If you are new to Node, just know this package is used in more than this code and you should install it regardless.
